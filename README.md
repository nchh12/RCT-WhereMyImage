# Note
This is the second project in which I had the pleasure to work with my friend Lam Nguyen, who is an already skilled mobile developer. I worked on developing and designing the interface for the Onboarding screen and some app permissions request popups, which allows me to dabble with some React Native and also with LottieFiles for easy-integrated animations.

# Where my Images
Caption-based images gallery search Application

## Usage

Find photos in gallery that match the user's filter tags (through provided keywords or userâ€™s description).
Use ML-Kit to integrate TensorFlow Lite model for processing images-labeling in asynchronous thread at native modules (Java, Swift) and emitting to React-native through RCTEventEmitter.

## Install

For Window users, you should run:

```
npm run all_window
```

or Mac_er only run:

```
npm run all
```

...to install neccessary packages and start metro bundle before build/run in Android Studio/Xcode
